    "# COVID-MultiVent\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID MultiVent System was developed through a collaboration between Dr. Arun Agarwal, pulmonary critical care fellow at the University of Missouri, and a group of medical students at the University of Pennsylvania with backgrounds in various types of engineering. The system allows for monitoring of pressure and volume delivered to each patient and incorporates valve components that allow for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and inspiratory volume to be modulated independently for each patient. We have created open source assembly resources for this system to expedite its adoption in hospitals around the world with dire need of ventilation resources. The system is assembled with components that can be readily found in most hospitals. If you have questions regarding the system please contact us at **covid.multivent@gmail.com** \n",
